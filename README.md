# controlFlow

### Description
The idea was to create a command line java program to choose lottery numbers from data gathered from the user, with an option to play again if you don't like
the first set of numbers. I decided a while loop was the cleanest implementation to accomplish this, one that checks a variable that's initialized to zero and
incremented if the user doesn't wish to play again.

### Technologies
Java built on the Eclipse IDE
